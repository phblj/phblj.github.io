The week before the wedding, we (Andrea and Parker) will be staying at the venue.  We'll be spending a lot of time preparing, but we also wanted to take some time to relax and spend time with friends.  

We'd like to invite you to join us.  We'll be arriving on Monday, July 24th.  We'd love you to come stay from the 24th to the 30th (we'll be staying elsewhere the night of the wedding).
