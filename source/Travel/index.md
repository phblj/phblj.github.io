San Diego's probably the most convenient airport, but if you prefer flying into one of LA's airports, it isn't too much longer a drive.  

Due to Parker commuting to Boston for four years and Andrea commuting to Emeryville for a year, we have a ton of Amtrak miles we'd be happy to use to get you to the wedding if you happen to live along the track and like train travel.
