The closest accommodations are at <a href="https://www.palacasino.com/">Pala Casino</a>.  In fact, we'll be running shuttles to the venue from the Pala Casino parking lot before the ceremony and at the end of the reception.  Even if you don't stay at the casino, you're encouraged to park there and take a shuttle up to the Condor's Nest.


== Hotel blocks

We have blocks of rooms reserved at two hotels in Rancho Bernardo.  These are a bit of a drive from the wedding venue, but they're much more affordable and closer to San Diego proper.  We'll be running a shuttle to and from these two hotels before and after the wedding to save you the drive.

As a note, California has hotel taxes that will increase listed prices by 13%.
