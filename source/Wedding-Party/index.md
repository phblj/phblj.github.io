## Dress

More info coming, but the current idea is that men are in grey, women in cream.  But not really hard and fast there-- you can really wear whatever you want.  We'll get some accutrem√≥n that match across party members-- slate blue for women, sage green for men.  Feel free to call/text/email with questions.

One hope is that you don't have to go out and buy something for the wedding you'll never wear again.

### Men

Got a light grey suit?  Awesome, wear that with a white shirt and brown shoes.  Only have funky color/black shoes?  Wear those.

It's an outdoor wedding, and it should be warm the day of.  If you've got a choice, go with the lighter fabric.

Have a dark grey/charcoal/black suit instead?  Wear that.  Blue suit?  That's cool too.  No suit?  Going to ask you to rent, then.  I think Luke's doing that-- you can ask him for details of where he's going or just forge your own way.

I'm hoping to provide some matching accessories-- boutonnieres, cuff links, pocket squares, ties, possibly other things.  So far I just have the links and we plan to do flowers.  You definitely don't need to do everything-- whatever your suit accommodates is fine.  

### Women

Similar to the men, we're asking people to wear off-white / cream, and we'll accessorize as possible.  Current plan is maybe a slate blue shawl/parasol combo?  I don't know, this is really Andrea's domain.  Maybe it's going to be blue face paint and sporrans. 

## Responsibilities

## Men

On the mens' side, it's fast-and-loose.  My only big requirement is that I'd like all of you in the wedding pictures, along with your partners and offspring if applicable.  

If you want, there's room up front to stand during the ceremony.  But I will not be offended if you need to do kid-wrangling duty or would just prefer to sit.  I'll probably ask a couple of you to do some ushing beforehand, as necessary.

There's no Best Man, but if anyone wants to take Reception Toast duties you're welcome to it.

For bachelor party planning, Matt and Luke are taking the reins there.  There's a good chance my scheudule will mean we skip this part, but I'm hopeful we'll find a weekend.

## Women

Andrea's not here right now, but I'm pretty sure this is what we discussed:

- We'll need four of you on the [litter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(vehicle))
- Andrea is going to need help with little things throughout the day-- dress management, light housecleaning, tax advice, palm-frond fanning.  You're all expected to fill in as needed before and during, and also a little after the ceremony.  Just until our first kid graduates highschool should be fine.
- I presume you've all recevied and practiced the Bollywood dance routine, so it hardly needs mentioning
- If either the bride or groom does anything embarrassing, you're expected to have a number of more embarrassing distractions prepared to quickly take attention away.
