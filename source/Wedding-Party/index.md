## Dress

More info coming, but the current idea is that men are in grey, women in cream.  But not really hard and fast there-- you can really wear whatever you want.  We'll get some accutremón that match across party members-- slate blue for women, sage green for men.  Feel free to call/text/email with questions.

One hope is that you don't have to go out and buy something for the wedding you'll never wear again.

#### Men

UPDATE:  For the sake of the pictures, we're asking all the men to wear a light grey suit with white shirt and brown shoes.  It's going to be warm, so I'd suggest against a vest or top hat, but feel free to wear it how you're comfortable.

No grey suit?  We're going to ask you to rent.  I think Luke's doing that-- you can ask him for details of where he's going or just forge your own way.  We're not going for a consistent style across the board, just similar colors.  So feel free to pick whatever suits (hah!) you.

I'm hoping to provide some matching accessories-- boutonnieres, cuff links, pocket squares, ties, possibly other things like socks.  You definitely don't need to do everything-- whatever your suit accommodates is fine.  I've sent an email out to ask which pieces you want-- be sure to respond or I'll be hounding you later.

#### Women

Similar to the men, we're asking people to wear off-white / cream, and we'll accessorize as possible.  Current plan is maybe a slate blue shawl/parasol combo?  I don't know, this is really Andrea's domain.  Maybe it's going to be blue face paint and sporrans. 

## Responsibilities

#### Men

On the mens' side, it's fast-and-loose.  My only big requirement is that I'd like all of you in the wedding pictures, along with your partners and offspring if applicable.  

If you want, there's room up front to stand during the ceremony.  But I will not be offended if you need to do kid-wrangling duty or would just prefer to sit.  I'll probably ask a couple of you to do some ushing beforehand, as necessary.

There's no Best Man, but if anyone wants to take Reception Toast duties you're welcome to it.

For bachelor party planning, Matt and Luke are taking the reins there.  There's a good chance my scheudule will mean we skip this part, but I'm hopeful we'll find a weekend.

Friday (the 28th) we'll be doing something in the morning.  Not sure what yet.

#### Women

Similar to the groomsmen above. Not all of you need to stand up front for the ceremony, but you do need to pose for some gorgeous pictures and hopefully walk down the aisle with the rest of the gang.

Cynthia is the maid-of-honor and will also likely be doing the ring-bearer/flower girl wrangling.

No [litter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(vehicle&#41;) despite Parker’s previous suggestion.

If either the bride or groom does anything embarrassing, you’re expected to have a number of more embarrassing distractions prepared to quickly take attention away.

## Timeline

### Thurs, 7/27, 10:30am
| Rehearsal walkthrough (OPTIONAL)
| The Condor's Nest
| 37537 Magee Rd, Pala, CA 92059

This was initially Friday, but it's definitely the lowest priority so we moved it to Thursday.  There's nothing fancy to be rehearsed, mostly just walk in/stand/walk out.  I know many of you can't make it-- I'll fill you in on your walking and standing obligations.  We've got it penciled in for two hours, but I'd be shocked if it took anywhere near that long.



### Fri, 7/28, 9:30am
| Groomsmen activity (just the men)
| Mission Bay
| 1010 Santa Clara Pl, San Diego, CA 92109

As a thanks for taking part in the wedding, I wanted to take you guys out to the ocean to get away from everybody for a couple hours.  Plan to leave your families at home.  Dress to get in the water, and particularly for those from northern latitudes, the sun.  Sunblock mandatory, sleeves and hats strongly encouraged.  Apart from your health, which I have a passing interest in, we'll both be in big trouble if anyone's bright red for the wedding photos.  It should be a few hours-- we should be done by 12:30pm.

Afterwards, if you don't want to head back to your lodging, you can shower at Andrea's parents' house or the club where the picnic is going to be.  I'll probably be staying, but I also need to get to the picnic a bit early to set up.



### Fri, 7/28, 4:00pm
| "Rehearsal" picnic
| Scripps Ranch Swim & Racquet Club
| 9875 Aviary Drive San Diego, CA 92131

Bring your family.  It'll go 4-8pm, and we'll feed you.  There should be bocce, beer, soccer, tennis, and swimming.  Super casual-- shorts, flip-flops are fine.  

We'll probably ask a couple of you to come early to help set up and/or make Costco+Target runs to pick up things we forgot.


### Sat, 7/29, All Day
| Wedding
| The Condor's Nest
| 37537 Magee Rd, Pala, CA 92059

Hopefully you all know what to wear by now.  

Wedding invitations say the ceremony starts at 3pm, which is when we should be ready, but it will more likely start around 3:30.  Between the ceremony and reception we'll go with the photographer to take the real pictures, then you're off the hook responsibility-wise.

#### Arrival time

##### Women
Hair and makeup starts at 8am.  That doesn't mean everyone needs to be at the venue by then-- talk to Andrea to work out fine-grained scheduling.

##### Men
I don't think there's a specific time you need to be at the venue, but a couple hours early gives us time to hang out a bit.  I think the photographer is going to fit in some groom-side before pictures, so make sure you arrive between 1 and 2pm at the latest.
