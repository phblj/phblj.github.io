## Dress

More info coming, but the current idea is that men are in grey, women in cream.  But not really hard and fast there-- you can really wear whatever you want.  We'll get some accutremón that match across party members-- slate blue for women, sage green for men.  Feel free to call/text/email with questions.

One hope is that you don't have to go out and buy something for the wedding you'll never wear again.

#### Men

UPDATE:  For the sake of the pictures, we're asking all the men to wear a light grey suit with brown shoes.  It's going to be warm, so I'd suggest against a vest or top hat, but feel free to wear it how you're comfortable.

No grey suit?  We're going to ask you to rent.  I think Luke's doing that-- you can ask him for details of where he's going or just forge your own way.  We're not going for a consistent style across the board, just similar colors.  So feel free to pick whatever suits (hah!) you.

I'm hoping to provide some matching accessories-- boutonnieres, cuff links, pocket squares, ties, possibly other things like socks.  You definitely don't need to do everything-- whatever your suit accommodates is fine.  I've sent an email out to ask which pieces you want-- be sure to respond or I'll be hounding you later.

#### Women

Similar to the men, we're asking people to wear off-white / cream, and we'll accessorize as possible.  Current plan is maybe a slate blue shawl/parasol combo?  I don't know, this is really Andrea's domain.  Maybe it's going to be blue face paint and sporrans. 

## Responsibilities

#### Men

On the mens' side, it's fast-and-loose.  My only big requirement is that I'd like all of you in the wedding pictures, along with your partners and offspring if applicable.  

If you want, there's room up front to stand during the ceremony.  But I will not be offended if you need to do kid-wrangling duty or would just prefer to sit.  I'll probably ask a couple of you to do some ushing beforehand, as necessary.

There's no Best Man, but if anyone wants to take Reception Toast duties you're welcome to it.

For bachelor party planning, Matt and Luke are taking the reins there.  There's a good chance my scheudule will mean we skip this part, but I'm hopeful we'll find a weekend.

#### Women

Similar to the groomsmen above. Not all of you need to stand up front for the ceremony, but you do need to pose for some gorgeous pictures and hopefully walk down the aisle with the rest of the gang.

Cynthia is the maid-of-honor and will also likely be doing the ring-bearer/flower girl wrangling.

No [litter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(vehicle&#41;) despite Parker’s previous suggestion.

If either the bride or groom does anything embarrassing, you’re expected to have a number of more embarrassing distractions prepared to quickly take attention away.
