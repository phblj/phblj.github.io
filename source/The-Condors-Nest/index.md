We're getting married at a property about an hour north of San Diego called [The Condor's Nest](http://www.the-condors-nest.com/).

<address>
The Condor's Nest
37537 Magee Rd
Pala, CA 92059

[Their directions page](http://www.the-condors-nest.com/DIRECTIONS-.html)

The Condor's Nest has asked us not to park at the venue.  To get everyone up there, we'll be running shuttles to and from the [Pala Casino](https://goo.gl/maps/UzUi7pSnN1D2) before and after the wedding.

## Common questions

#### What's the attire?

This will be a "California outdoor wedding."  Beach formal / semiformal.  Keep in mind it will be warm and likely sunny.  

#### Can I bring my kids?

Definitely!  We've got a decent number of them coming, so they should be in good company.  Your whole family's included on the invitations.  

#### Can I bring a date?

Absolutely!  If we failed to make it clear, every invitation comes with an implicit +1.  If you want to bring more than just a +1, let us know-- we may have a bit of extra flexibility.

#### What's the venue like?

The wedding will be outdoors.  It's at 3pm, and it's supposed to be warm (upper 70s/low 80s) that time of year.  The ceremony shouldn't be too long, and we'll have some shade and refreshment available afterwards.

#### Any plans Sunday?

Before we start the honeymoon, Andrea and I are going to be having breakfast at the Pala Casino the morning after the wedding.  We'd love to see anyone who wants to drop by to join us.  We'll be starting at 9:00am at the "Poolside Caf√© & Bar."  We're not sure what seating's like or how many people to expect, but we'll make it work.  They have omelettes.
