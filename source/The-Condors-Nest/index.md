We're getting married at a property about an hour north of San Diego called The Condor's Nest.

## Can I bring...

#### My kids?

Definitely!  We'll do our best to keep them occupied during the reception if they're school-aged.  Your whole family's included on the invitations.  

#### A date?

Absolutely!  If we failed to make it clear, every invitation comes with an implicit +1.  If you want to bring more than just a +1, let us know-- we may have a bit of extra flexibility.


## What's the venue like?

The wedding will be outdoors.  It's at 3pm, and it's supposed to be warm (upper 70s/low 80s) that time of year.  The ceremony shouldn't be too long, and we'll have some shade and refreshment available afterwards.
